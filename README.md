# 🛰️ Autonomous Navigation Drone – Phase One (SolidWorks CAD Model)

This repository contains **Phase One** of the Autonomous Navigation Drone project, focusing on the **mechanical design** and **3D modeling** of the drone using **SolidWorks**. This phase establishes the structural foundation for future implementation of autonomous navigation using ROS 2 and onboard sensors.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to develop a fully autonomous drone with real-time navigation, obstacle avoidance, and environment mapping capabilities. This phase concentrates on:

- Conceptual and functional design
- 3D modeling of the drone frame and components
- Mounting provisions for sensors, flight controller, and battery
- Exportable files for prototyping and future simulation

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **SolidWorks** – Main tool for 3D modeling and mechanical design  
- **STL/STEP Export** – For 3D printing or future simulation use  
- **Future Tools (planned)** – ROS 2, Gazebo, PX4, RViz2
